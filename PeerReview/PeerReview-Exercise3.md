# Peer-Review for Programming Exercise 3 #

## Description ##

For this assignment, you will be giving feedback on the completeness of assignment three: Pikmini. To do so, we will give you a rubric to provide feedback. Please give positive criticism and suggestions on how to fix segments of code.

You only need to review code modified or created by the student you are reviewing. You do not have to check the code and project files that the instructor gave out.

Abusive or hateful language or comments will not be tolerated and will result in a grade penalty or be considered a breach of the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.

If there are any questions at any point, please email the TA.   

## Due Date and Submission Information
See the official course schedule for due date.

A successful submission should consist of a copy of this markdown document template that is modified with your peer review. This review document should be placed into the base folder of the repo you are reviewing in the master branch. The file name should be the same as in the template: `CodeReview-Exercise3.md`. You must also include your name and email address in the `Peer-reviewer Information` section below.

If you are in a rare situation where two peer-reviewers are on a single repository, append your UC Davis user name before the extension of your review file. An example: `CodeReview-Exercise3-username.md`. Both reviewers should submit their reviews in the master branch.
